<h1>The best Movies according to Nokue</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Color purple</h3>
<p>A great movie that has great themes and lessons. What stands out for me is the story of courage,resiliance and triumph over male chauvinism and societal expactations placed upon women. The little girl places her faith on God even though her life doesnt seem to be protected by God. She keeps her faith until she is reunited with her sister and children.

<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>A great movie depicted from the marvel comics. Its the first movie I watched with a Black super hero who comes from a place that poses vibranium which runs the world. I loved the potrayal of women as strong soldiers and protectors of the land. I loved the different themes and twists to the storline.

<h3>Taken</h3>
<p>A great action movie that shows a father's love for his daughter. He uses all his skills he acquired over the years to break into a human trafficking ring to rescue his daughter.
